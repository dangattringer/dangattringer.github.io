# Docker Explained: From Containers to Engine

Docker is more than just running containers it's a powerful platform for building, shipping, and managing isolated environments. Knowing **how Docker works** under the hood, including its core components, helps with troubleshooting, optimization, and working effectively with tools like Kubernetes. These notes cover **Docker container** basics and dive into the **Docker Engine architecture**.

## What is a Docker Container?

A Docker container is essentially **a process with isolation**. Unlike virtual machines (VMs) that simulate entire hardware stacks, containers leverage existing host operating system features (like kernel namespaces and control groups) to create sandboxed environments for applications.

### Key Benefits of Using Containers

* **Consistency:** Applications run reliably across development, testing, and production environments.
* **Efficiency:** Containers start faster and use fewer CPU/RAM resources compared to VMs due to sharing the host OS kernel.
* **Portability:** Build an application image once and run it anywhere Docker is installed.
* **Isolation:** Enhances security by separating processes and dependencies; prevents conflicts.
* **Scalability:** Easily scale applications horizontally by adding or removing container instances..

## The Docker Platform: Client and Engine

The [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) platform primarily consists of two parts:

* **The Docker CLI (client):** The command-line tool (`docker`) used to issue commands.
* **The Docker Engine (server/daemon `dockerd`):** A background service that manages Docker objects and executes commands received from the CLI via a REST API.

The CLI translates user-friendly commands (like `docker run`) into API requests sent to the Docker Engine. The Engine then handles the complex tasks of building images, starting/stopping containers, managing networks, and storing data.

### The Three Pillars of Containerization

Container technology relies on core Linux kernel features:

1. **Isolation Namespaces**: Containers use Linux **namespaces** to provide isolated views of system resources:
    * `pid`: Isolates process IDs.
    * `net`: Isolates network interfaces, IP addresses, and ports.
    * `mnt`: Isolates filesystem mount points.
    * `uts`: Isolates hostname and domain name.
    * `ipc`: Isolates inter-process communication resources.
    * `user`: Isolates user and group IDs.

2. **Resource Control (cgroups)**: **cgroups** limit and monitor resource usage (CPU, memory, disk I/O) for a collection of processes. Docker uses cgroups to enforce resource limits on containers.

3. **Portability (Images)**: Docker images are immutable, layered filesystem snapshots containing the application, libraries, and dependencies. This packaging ensures consistency wherever the image is run – from a developer laptop to production servers.

### Docker Across Different Teams

Different teams often value different aspects of Docker:

| Team         | Priority                           | How Docker Helps                                   |
| :----------- | :--------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------- |
| **Devs**     | Modularity, Development Speed      | Isolated dependencies per container, fast spin-up. |
| **DevOps**   | CI/CD, Environment Consistency     | Identical builds/runs locally, staging, prod.      |
| **Ops**      | Scalability, Monitoring, Stability | Standardized units, resource limits, easier management. |
| **Security** | Isolation, Vulnerability Control   | Kernel namespaces limit attack surface, image scanning. |
| **Business** | Cost Efficiency, Agility           | Higher density than VMs, faster deployment cycles. |

## Related Technologies: Wasm and Kubernetes

* **Wasm (WebAssembly):** A binary instruction format offering potential benefits in size, speed, and sandboxing. While promising, the Wasm ecosystem is less mature than containers for general server-side applications. Docker is exploring integration, but containers remain dominant.
* **[Kubernetes](../kubernetes/index.mdx):** The standard platform for container orchestration (managing containerized applications at scale). Newer Kubernetes versions typically use `containerd` directly as the container runtime, bypassing the main Docker daemon but still running OCI-compliant containers (including those built with Docker).

## Virtualization vs Containerization

[Virtual Machines (VMs)](https://www.vmware.com/) were a significant step, allowing multiple applications to run safely on shared hardware. However, VMs virtualize the *hardware*, meaning each VM needs a full guest operating system.

This leads to drawbacks:

* High resource overhead (CPU, RAM) per VM for the guest OS.
* Separate patching and monitoring required for each guest OS.
* Larger image sizes and slower boot times.

Containers virtualize the *operating system*. They share the host OS kernel, making them much more lightweight.

</figure>

This allows a single host to run significantly more containers than VMs, leading to better resource utilization, faster startup, and smaller image sizes.

## Understanding the Docker Engine Architecture

The original Docker Engine was a monolithic daemon that included everything from the API to container execution using [LXC](https://linuxcontainers.org/) initially. This became difficult to maintain and innovate on.

The engine has since been refactored into separate, specialized components, promoting modularity and adherence to standards like the **[Open Container Initiative (OCI)](https://opencontainers.org/)**.

### Core Docker Engine Components

   alt="Docker Engine components that are used to run containers and lists the primary responsibilities of each component." />
  <figcaption>Docker Engine components</figcaption>
</figure>

1. **Docker Daemon (`dockerd`):** The main service. It exposes the Docker API, processes requests, and orchestrates operations by communicating with other components, primarily `containerd`.
2. **containerd:** A high-level container runtime focused on managing the complete container lifecycle. It handles image transfer/storage, container execution/supervision, and manages storage/networking. `dockerd` communicates with `containerd` via [gRPC](https://grpc.io/). `containerd` itself is designed to be embedded into larger systems (like Docker Engine or Kubernetes).
3. **runc:** A low-level container runtime; the reference implementation of the OCI runtime specification. Its job is to create and run containers according to the OCI spec. `containerd` uses `runc` (or another OCI-compatible runtime) to handle the actual process of creating namespaces, cgroups, and starting the container process defined in an OCI bundle.
4. **Shim:** A small intermediary process launched by `containerd` for each container.
    * It allows `runc` to exit after starting the container, decoupling the container's lifecycle from the low-level runtime.
    * It acts as the container's parent process, reporting the exit status back to `containerd`.
    * It keeps STDIN/STDOUT streams open.
    * Enables "daemonless containers" – `dockerd` or `containerd` can be restarted without terminating running containers.

### How a Container Starts (Simplified Flow)

When you run `docker run -d --name my-container nginx`:

1. **Docker CLI** sends an API request to the **Docker Daemon (`dockerd`)**.
2. **`dockerd`** receives the request and calls **`containerd`** (via gRPC) to start a container based on the `nginx` image.
3. **`containerd`** manages pulling the image if needed and prepares an OCI runtime bundle (config.json + root filesystem).
4. **`containerd`** calls the appropriate **`containerd-shim`**.
5. The **shim** calls **`runc`** with the OCI bundle path.
6. **`runc`** interfaces with the Linux kernel to create the necessary namespaces and cgroups and launches the container process (`nginx` in this case).
7. **`runc`** exits once the container process is started.
8. The **shim** remains as the container's parent, managing its streams and reporting its status to `containerd`.

  alt="Flowchart of 'docker run': CLI -> Daemon API -> containerd -> containerd-shim -> runc creates container process." />

This decoupled architecture makes the system more robust and allows components like `containerd` and `runc` to be used independently, for example, directly by Kubernetes.
