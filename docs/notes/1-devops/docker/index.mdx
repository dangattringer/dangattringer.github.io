Docker is a platform designed to make it easier to build, share, and run applications in isolated environments called **containers**. These containers ensure that software runs uniformly and predictably, regardless of the underlying infrastructure. 

Integrating Docker into a development workflow offers many advantages for building, testing, and deploying applications.

*   **Consistent Environments:** By bundling dependencies within a container, Docker eliminates inconsistencies between development, staging, and production setups.
*   **Service Isolation:** Each container runs in its own isolated environment, preventing conflicts between services and enhancing security.
*   **Simplified CI/CD:** Docker streamlines continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines. New code can be automatically built into an image, tested in a container, and deployed to production with confidence.
*   **Multi-Container Applications:** For complex systems with multiple services (e.g., a web server, database, and caching layer), **Docker Compose** allows you to define and run the entire application stack with a single command.


This section provides core Docker concepts, commands, and best practices.
