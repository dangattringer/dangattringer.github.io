Kubernetes, also known as K8s, is an open-source platform for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. While tools like [Docker](docker) are excellent for creating and running individual containers, Kubernetes orchestrates them at scale, ensuring that complex, multi-container applications run reliably across a cluster of machines.

By managing the application lifecycle, Kubernetes provides a robust framework for running distributed systems resiliently.

*   **Automated Scaling and Self-Healing:** Kubernetes can automatically scale applications based on resource usage and restart containers that fail, replacing and rescheduling them on healthy nodes to ensure high availability.
*   **Service Discovery and Load Balancing:** It assigns stable IP addresses and DNS names to containers and can load-balance traffic across them, simplifying communication between microservices.
*   **Declarative Configuration:** You define the desired state of your application (e.g., "run three instances of this container"), and Kubernetes works continuously to maintain that state.
*   **Environment Consistency:** It provides a consistent runtime environment across development, testing, and production, whether on-premises, in a public cloud, or in a hybrid setup.

This section covers the core architecture, key components, and foundational concepts of the Kubernetes ecosystem.
