# Infrastructure as code (IaC)

**Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** is the practice of managing and provisioning IT infrastructure (like networks, virtual machines, load balancers, and databases) using definition files, rather than manual processes or interactive configuration tools. It treats infrastructure setup like software development, applying coding practices such as version control and automated testing.
eployed repeatably.

**Why IaC? The Evolution of Infrastructure Management**

Managing infrastructure has evolved significantly:

1. **Manual Configuration:** Initially, system administrators configured servers and network devices individually, often relying on documentation or scripts shared informally. This became unmanageable at scale.
2. **Configuration Management:** As cloud computing grew, tools like **Puppet**, **Chef**, and **Ansible** emerged. These tools automate the configuration of *software* and settings *on* existing machines, ensuring consistency across many servers. Tools like **Packer** also helped by creating pre-configured "golden images" for reuse.
3. **Infrastructure as Code:** IaC takes the next logical step. Instead of just configuring software on machines, IaC tools automate the creation, modification, and destruction of the *infrastructure itself* (the servers, networks, databases, etc.). This allows entire platforms to be defined in code and deployed repeatably.

**Benefits of IaC:**

* **Automation:** Reduces manual effort and potential for human error.
* **Speed & Efficiency:** Faster provisioning and updates compared to manual methods.
* **Consistency & Reproducibility:** Ensures environments are created the same way every time.
* **Version Control:** Infrastructure definitions can be stored in Git (or similar), providing history, collaboration, and rollback capabilities.
* **Cost Reduction:** Minimizes errors and optimizes resource deployment.
