# Infrastructure as code (IaC)

Managing IT infrastructure used to be a manual, error-prone process. System administrators would configure servers one by one, relying on detailed documentation and custom scripts that quickly became outdated. This approach was slow, inconsistent, and couldn't keep up with the demands of modern applications.

**Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** solves this by treating infrastructure—networks, virtual machines, load balancers, and databases—like software. Instead of manual setup, you define your infrastructure in configuration files. This allows you to build, change, and manage your environment in a safe, consistent, and repeatable way, making slow, manual processes a thing of the past.
eployed repeatably.

## The Evolution of Infrastructure Management

Managing infrastructure has changed a lot over time:

1. **Manual Configuration:** Initially, system administrators configured everything by hand. This was time-consuming and led to inconsistencies, where a "production" server might have slightly different settings than a "staging" server, causing difficult-to-diagnose bugs.
2. **Configuration Management:** As cloud computing grew, tools like **Ansible**, **Puppet**, and **Chef** emerged. These tools automate the configuration of *software* and settings *on* existing machines, ensuring consistency across many servers. Tools like **Packer** also helped by creating pre-configured "golden images" for reuse.
3. **Infrastructure as Code:** IaC takes the final step. Instead of just configuring existing machines, IaC tools like **Terraform** automate the creation, modification, and destruction of the *infrastructure itself*. This allows you to define an entire cloud environment—from the virtual network to the databases and servers—in code.

## How Does IaC Work? Declarative vs. Imperative

IaC tools generally follow one of two approaches:

* **Declarative (What):** You define the **desired state** of your system. For example, "I want three web servers, a load balancer, and a database." You don't specify *how* to create them. The IaC tool figures out the necessary steps to achieve that state. **Terraform** is a leading declarative tool—the most common approach today.
* **Imperative (How):** You write a script that specifies the **exact commands** to execute in order. For example, "First, create a virtual network. Second, create three servers. Third, configure the load balancer." Early automation scripts and some configuration management tools can work this way.

The declarative model is generally preferred because it is more resilient and predictable. If you make a change to your definition file, the tool can calculate the difference and apply only the necessary updates, additions, or deletions.

## Key Benefits of Adopting IaC

Treating your infrastructure as code unlocks several powerful advantages that are central to modern [DevOps](../devops) practices.

* **Automation and Speed:** Provisioning a complete production environment can be done in minutes instead of days or weeks. This drastically reduces manual effort and accelerates development cycles.
* **Consistency and Reproducibility:** By defining infrastructure in code, you eliminate configuration drift. Every environment—from development to production—is created from the same source, ensuring it is identical every time.
* **Version Control:** Storing your infrastructure definitions in a version control system like Git provides a full audit trail. You can see who changed what, when, and why. It also enables collaboration, code reviews, and the ability to roll back to a previous state if something goes wrong.
* **Reduced Risk and Increased Reliability:** Automation minimizes the potential for human error during configuration. You can also test your infrastructure code before deploying it, just like application code, to catch issues early.
* **Cost Reduction:** IaC helps optimize resource usage by making it easy to create and destroy environments on demand. For example, you can automatically spin up a testing environment to run a test suite and then tear it down immediately afterward, so you only pay for what you use.

## Popular Infrastructure as Code Tools

Several tools dominate the IaC landscape, each with its own strengths:

* **[Terraform](./terraform/index.mdx):** An open-source tool from HashiCorp that has become the industry standard for infrastructure provisioning. It uses a declarative approach and supports hundreds of cloud providers and services through its extensive provider ecosystem.
* **[Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/):** A agentless automation tool built for configuration management and deploying applications. While it can perform some provisioning, it's often used to configure servers after they've been created by a tool like Terraform.
* **[AWS CloudFormation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html):** A service provided by Amazon Web Services that allows you to model and provision AWS resources using YAML or JSON templates. It is tightly integrated with the AWS ecosystem but is limited to AWS resources.
* **[Azure Resource Manager (ARM) Templates](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/overview):** The native IaC solution for Microsoft Azure, similar to CloudFormation for AWS.
* **[Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/):** A modern IaC tool that lets you define infrastructure using general-purpose programming languages like Python, TypeScript, Go, and C#.
