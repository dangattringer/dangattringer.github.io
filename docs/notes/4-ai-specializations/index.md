Artificial Intelligence is a broad field, spanning a wide range of domains, techniques, and applications. This section provides an overview of the key specializations within AI, each with its own unique focus and methodologies.

- **Computer Vision (CV)**: Techniques for interpreting and processing visual data.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Methods for understanding and generating human language.
- **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**: Learning by interacting with environments through rewards and feedback.
- **Agentic Systems**: Frameworks for autonomous AI agents that can perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific goals.
- **Vector Databases**: Specialized databases designed to store, manage, and search high-dimensional vectors.
