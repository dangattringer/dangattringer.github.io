Agentic systems represent the next evolution of generative AI, moving beyond simple prompt-and-response interactions to create autonomous agents capable of complex problem-solving. While Large Language Models (LLMs) provide the core reasoning engine, agentic systems build a framework around them, allowing the AI to plan, execute tasks, and interact with its environment to achieve a specific goal.

By giving an LLM the ability to act, agentic systems unlock a new level of automation and capability.

* **Reasoning and Planning:** An agent can take a high-level objective (e.g., "research the best laptops for video editing") and break it down into a sequence of logical steps.
* **Tool Use:** It can interact with external tools like web browsers, APIs, or code interpreters to gather information, perform calculations, or execute commands.
* **Memory and Context:** Agents maintain memory to learn from past actions and refine strategies. This is often implemented using **[vector stores](../ai-specializations/vector-stores)**, which allow the agent to efficiently retrieve relevant information from vast datasets, enabling sophisticated long-term memory.
* **Standardized Communication:** Protocols like the **[Model Context Protocol (MCP)](model-context-protocol/index.mdx)** provide a common language for agents, models, and tools to share context and state, ensuring seamless collaboration within the system.
* **Autonomous Execution:** The system can carry out its plan independently, adapting to unexpected results and making decisions without requiring step-by-step human guidance.
