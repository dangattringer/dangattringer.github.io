[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a distributed version control system that helps developers track changes in their codebase, collaborate with others, and manage project history efficiently.

Whether you're working on small personal projects or large-scale applications, Git provides the tools to:

- Keep a detailed history of changes
- Create and manage branches for different features or fixes
- Collaborate with others through platforms like [GitHub](https://github.com/), [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/), and [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/product/)
- Resolve conflicts and merge code smoothly
- Automate workflows through integration with CI/CD tools

This section includes notes, resources, and practical workflows for using Git effectively in day-to-day development.
